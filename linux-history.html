    <h1>History of Linux and Difference Between Unix and Linux</h1>
    <h2>History of Linux</h2>
    <p>
        Linux is an open-source operating system kernel first released by <strong>Linus Torvalds</strong> in 1991. 
        Inspired by Unix, Linux was designed to be free and customizable, enabling developers and enthusiasts to 
        contribute to its codebase. Over the years, Linux has grown into a widely-used operating system, powering 
        everything from servers and desktops to mobile devices and embedded systems.
    </p>

    <h2>What is Unix?</h2>
    <p>
        Unix is a multiuser, multitasking operating system originally developed in the 1970s by AT&T's Bell Labs. 
        It is proprietary and forms the basis of many modern operating systems like macOS, AIX, HP-UX and Solaris.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Differences Between Unix and Linux</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>License:</strong> Unix is mostly proprietary, while Linux is open-source and free.</li>
        <li><strong>Development:</strong> Linux is community-driven, whereas Unix is developed by specific vendors.</li>
        <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Linux can run on a wide range of hardware, while Unix is generally hardware-specific.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Linux is free, but Unix often requires licensing fees.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Linux is widely used in cloud computing, servers, and desktops, whereas Unix is more prevalent in enterprise environments.</li>
    </ul>
