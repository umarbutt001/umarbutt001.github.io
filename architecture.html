<h1> The architecture of the Linux system</h1>

<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/algodailyrandomassets/curriculum/operating-systems/linux_architecture.png" alt="Main Photo" width="500">
<p>The Linux Architecture consists of the following components:
<ul>
    <li> Kernel </li>
    <li> Hardware</li>
    <li> Shell</li>  
    <li> Applications and Utilities</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2> <ol> <li> Kernel</li> </h2>
<p>
<ul>Kernel is one of the most important parts of the operating system and it is the main interface between Hardware and its processes

</ul>
<ul>Name of the Linux Operating system's Kernel is also Linux</ul>
<ul>Kernel is the lowest level of software that can interface with computer hardware</ul>

</p>
<h2> <li> Hardware</li></h2> <p>
<ul>Hardware part in Linux consists of a peripheral device such as RAM, CPU, HDD etc</ul> </p>

<h2>  <li> Shell</li> </h2>
<p>
    If we want to interact with Hardware in Linux, we will interact with Shell which is a command line interface(CLI) via which we tell Kernel about what function the Hardware should perform and then Kernel passes the message to Hardware to perform the requested action.
</p>

<h2> <li>Applications and Utilities</li></ol></h2>
<p>
    It is the computer's Operating system interface to the hardware. There are a lot of different types of software applications running on the Operating system to manage the Hardware.
