<h1> The architecture of the Linux system</h1>

<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/algodailyrandomassets/curriculum/operating-systems/linux_architecture.png" alt="Main Photo" width="500">
<p>Linux OS is composed of several components which work in accordance to keep the system running. Let's discuss them below.</p>

<p>The Linux Architecture consists of the following components:
<ul>
    <li> Kernel </li>
    <li> Hardware</li>
    <li> Shell</li>  
    <li> Applications and Utilities</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2> <ul> <li> Kernel</li> </h2>
<p>
Kernel is one of the most important parts of the operating system and it is the main interface between Hardware and its processes. Name of the Linux Operating system's Kernel is also Linux. Kernel is the lowest level of software that can interface with computer hardware
</p>
<p>The core part of an operating system is the kernel. Kernels are responsible for the execution, controlling, and allocating memory of processes in a system. It directly interacts with the machine hardware and hides the low-level details during the execution of programs.</p>

<h2> <li> Hardware</li></h2> <p>
    Peripheral devices such as RAM, HDD, CPU, are part of the hardware layer. They receive function calls from the kernel to perform the desired operations.
 </p>

<h2>  <li> Shell</li> </h2>
<p>
    If we want to interact with Hardware in Linux, we will interact with Shell which is a command line interface(CLI) via which we tell Kernel about what function the Hardware should perform and then Kernel passes the message to Hardware to perform the requested action.
</p>

<h2> <li>Applications and Utilities</li></ul></h2>
<p>
    It is the computer's Operating system interface to the hardware. There are a lot of different types of software applications running on the Operating system to manage the Hardware.
